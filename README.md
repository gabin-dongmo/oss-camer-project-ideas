# Project ideas

Our goal in the osscameroon community is to build the opensource solutions our country needs.
This Repository is a crowdsourced collection of project ideas submitted by the community and that might require our
amazing pool of contributors to work on.

Checkout the [project ideas](https://github.com/osscameroon/project-ideas/issues) submitted by the community.

## You have an idea

If you have identified a problem Cameroonians are facing on a daily basis,
such as difficulties to find a list of good restaurants and you have an idea of software
that you think might help solve that problem, feel free to [submit a project idea on this repository](https://github.com/osscameroon/project-ideas/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=project-idea-template.yaml&title=%5Bedit%5D+Your+Project+name).

Once you have submited your idea, the community will be notified and you will be invited to describe your idea clearly to us.

## You are a developer

If you are a developer looking for a cool open source project to work on, checkout this list of [projects ideas](https://github.com/osscameroon/project-ideas/issues).

The projects have a set of labels that indicates the status and or complexity of the project.

#### Statuses

* Started - *The project is currently under development*
* Done - *The project had a v1 release, and is being actively maintened*
* Stalled - *The project hasn't progressed a lot in a while, and have no active maintainers*

Depending on the status of the project you may decide to join a project that is currently under development,
pick up a project that has not started yet or grab a stalled project to make it move forward.
